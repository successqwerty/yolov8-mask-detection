#  Face Mask Detection using YOLOv8

#  Project Description
This project implements a **custom object detection system** using **YOLOv8**
to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in images and videos.

#  Project Aim
The main aim of this project is to train a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset to
classify people into:
- Mask
- No Mask

#  Why Mask Detection?
Mask detection can be useful in:
- Hospitals
- Public places
- Safety monitoring systems

Manual monitoring is inefficient, so computer vision-based automation helps
improve accuracy.

#  Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV

#  Project Status
 Project setup completed  
 Dataset preparation and training will be added step by step

## Classes
- Mask
- No Mask
